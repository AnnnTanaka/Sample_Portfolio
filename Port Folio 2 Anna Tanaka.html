                <p>This is my STEAM project in summer vacation.I reserched Dilatancy Phenomenon. Dilatancy Phenomenon is 
			    the volue change observed in granular materials when they are subjected to sheer deformations.
				And especially, I want to knew Golden ratio and what happens if the condition are changed. So I reserched 
				these two things. This project is not to easy for me. However, this project is good leran for me.

				<p>This is my worst design project video. Please look at this video.
				   I found the worst design at ICT. It is a table in Group work room. I think these table 
				   is worst design because these table are very slippery. So,I thought solution. My solution is 
                   put a slip on the table. I  made non slip table bases with 3D printer. </p>
